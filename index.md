# StylePeekr Privacy Policy

Last Updated: [25/03/2025]

## Overview

StylePeekr is a Chrome extension that allows web designers and developers to inspect CSS styles, extract color palettes, and view page assets. This privacy policy explains how StylePeekr handles user data.

## Data Collection

StylePeekr is designed with your privacy as a priority. The extension does not collect or store any personal data, browsing history, or other sensitive information.

## How StylePeekr Works

StylePeekr processes website content (CSS styles, colors, and assets) entirely locally within your browser. This processing is necessary to provide the core functionality of the extension:

- Element inspection and style analysis
- Color palette extraction
- Asset identification and download

All operations are performed locally within your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Permissions Used

StylePeekr requires minimal permissions to function:

- **activeTab**: Allows StylePeekr to function only on the tab you're currently viewing, and only when you activate the extension.
- **scripting**: Required to analyze page styles and extract visual elements for the inspector, palette, and assets features.

## Future Updates

In future versions, StylePeekr may collect anonymous, non-identifying usage statistics such as browser version, platform information, and feature usage patterns to help improve the extension. This would only be implemented with clear user notification and consent, and would never include personal data, browsing history, or website content.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
